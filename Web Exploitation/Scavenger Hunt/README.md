# Scavenger Hnt SOlution
First part of the flag was on a comment in the page source "picoCTF{t"
Second one was on the css code, 
I opened a js script , it  said "How can I keep Google from indexing my website? ", the file used to instruct search engines on which parts of the site should not be indexed is called "robots.txt" , so going there was another piece of the flag and another hint "I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?" a common file for apache server is ".htaccess", for configuration settings we found part 4 of the flag and another int "I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there."
macOS creates a file called ".DS_Store" this folder stores info about other folders , there was the last piece of the flag.
