# Trickster SOlution

Fist of all i tried uploading a non png image , in the source code has accept=".png", so i changed a random pdf file and added ".png" but it said there was an error this was probably a backend verification of the file, nothing about the flag.
Went to /robots.txt saw a directory called uploads and an file named instructions.txt
Checked the if the website is html or php , its php because "index.php" so i uploaded a php webshell has a php file, it lets you do this because it only checks for .png name, it says the file is not valid png image so it must be a backend verification, it the instructions.txt says "make sure the magic bytes match (not sure what this is exactly but wikipedia says that the first few bytes contain 'PNG' in hexadecimal: "50 4E 47" )", so lets change the webshell and add PHP in the initial bytes, and it was uploaded .
So next i went to files directory and has a php webshell ready for me , i checked the files lsit nothing of interest, tried going to root did not have permission , has a uweb user a probably have access to var folder so i did ls -l /var/www/html, and i saw all the files in that folder there was a txt file so i opened it in browser and saw the flag
