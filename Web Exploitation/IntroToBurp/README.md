# IntroToBurp Solution

First form does not matter the input i tried to look for any flags could not find any, next submit the otp value , but i have no otp value? So that looks like the flag is around, mimic the otp request on python , you can see on chrome devtools that the payload has a variable called "otp" so delete the payload and the browser gives you the flag
